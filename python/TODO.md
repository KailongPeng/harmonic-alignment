## Features

* implement diffusion wavelets

## Computational savings

* do we need all eigenvectors of X and Y?
* do we need to return all eigenvectors of the aligned data?
* should we parallelize building `wavelet_X` and `wavelet_Y`?
* can we parallelise 

## Memory savings

* can we make `transform` sparse?
* can we make `E` sparse?

## Code maintanence

* rename `E` and `blocks` to something more informative
